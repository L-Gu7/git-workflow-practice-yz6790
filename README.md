# A Website I Found Interesting
This is a website I want to share. [Codecademy-Front_End](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path)<br>

# Reason
[Codecademy-Front_End](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path) is where I learned front-end technologies from. It is fun to learn a new programming language through practicing it, and this website makes it happen.
<p>
Also it covers most of the front-end knowledge. A beautiful page will come up step by step with the skills you learned.
